Version jump to 1.5-0 as several changes have been implemented.

New functions:
 - metacor        (meta-analysis of correlations)
 - forest         (generic method for forest plots)
 - forest.meta    (generic method for forest plots)
 - radial         (generic method for radial plots)
 - radial.default (generic method for radial plots)
 - radial.meta    (generic method for radial plots)
 - asin2p         (function used internally)
 - logit2p        (function used internally)
 - xlab           (function used internally)
 - z2cor          (function used internally)

Functions forest.meta:
 - new arguments (pooled.totals, pooled.events) to specify whether
   total number of observations and events should be displayed in the plot
 - new argument (pscale) to rescale proportions for objects of class metaprop
 - modified so that argument label is recognised for other
   effect measures than RR, OR, and HR
 - modified so that argument xlim is recognised for other
   effect measures than RR, OR, and HR
 - arguments rightlabs and leftlabs accept NAs for columns
   using default labels
 - modified so that significant digits are printed uniformly
 - correct sum of percentage weight is printed for random effects model
   in forest plots with subgroups
 - x limits (min,max) of the plot are defined by the width of
   confidence intervals instead of (0,1) for objects of class metaprop  

Function metaprop:
 - implementation of additional transformations:
   log transformation, logit transformation, raw, i.e. untransformed, proportions
 - new argument sm to choose summary measure (i.e. transformation)
 - use of argument freeman.tukey is deprecated (use argument sm instead)

Functions funnel and funnel.meta:
 - argument y removed

Functions labbe and labbe.meta:
 - argument y removed

Functions trimfill and trimfill.meta:
 - argument seTE removed

Function summary.meta:
 - new list objects H.w, I2.w, Q.b.fixed and Q.b.random
   for heterogeneity statistics within subgroups

Extension for meta-analysis of correlations:
- forest.meta, metacum, metainf, print.meta,
  print.summary.meta, summary.meta

Function plot.meta:
 - a warning is printed that the function is no longer maintained
   (function forest.meta should be used instead)

New list element version with information on version number of
meta package used to create an object (applies only to object
creating functions, e.g. metabin, metabias).

Update of several help pages.

Use file NEWS instead of ChangeLog to document changes.


2010-01-12, version 1.1-8

Functions summary.meta, print.summary.meta:
 - modified so that a test for subgroup differences
   is not calculated and printed for meta-analyses
   using the Mantel-Haenszel method for binary data


2010-01-11, version 1.1-7

Functions metabin, metacont, metagen, metaprop:
 - modified so that a sensible default value is used for argument bylab
   if argument byvar is not missing


2010-01-11, version 1.1-6

Function forest:
 - modified so that additional columns are printed in the correct order
   if argument sort or order is used


2009-12-21, version 1.1-5

Function forest (incl. help page):
 - new argument digits specifying minimal number of significant digits
   for treatment estimate and its confidence interval


2009-11-04, version 1.1-4

Function summary.meta:
 - modified so that results for subgroups (if byvar != NULL)
   are calculated for both fixed effect and random effects model:
   * list 'within' no longer returned by function summary.meta
   * lists 'within.fixed' and 'within.random' returned by
     function summary.meta
 - modified so that variable name of subgroups is printed
   correctly
 - check whether input is an object of class summary.meta

Function print.summary.meta:
 - modified so that a warning is printed if both comb.fixed and
   comb.random are TRUE and results for subgroups are supposed to
   be printed

Help pages of functions print.summary.meta and forest updated:
 - detailed information on printing and plotting of subgroup
   results if both comb.fixed and comb.random are TRUE

Help page of function metagen updated:
 - new example with meta-analysis of survival data


2009-10-30, version 1.1-3

New functions trimfill, trimfill.default and trimfill.meta:
 - generic method for trim-and-fill method


2009-10-09, version 1.1-2

New functions labbe, labbe.default, labbe.metabin:
 - produce L'Abbe plots

New functions funnel, funnel.default and funnel.meta:
 - generic method for funnel plots

Functions funnel.default and funnel.meta:
 - modified so that contour-enhanced funnel plots can be produced
   (new arguments: contour.levels, col.contour, ref)
 - modified so that study labels can be printed on funnel plot
   (new arguments: studlab, cex.studlab)
 - modified so that line type, width and colour can be changed for
   fixed effect treatment effect
   (new arguments: lty.fixed, lwd.fixed, col.fixed)
 - modified so that random effects treatment effect can be plotted
   (new arguments: comb.random, lty.random, lwd.random, col.random)
 - new default values for arguments:
   * pch=21 (previously: pch=1)
   * comb.fixed=x$comb.fixed
 - modified so that background colour of points in funnel plot can
   be changed
   (new argument: bg)

Function forest:
 - new default values for arguments lab.e and lab.c: x$label.e and
   x$label.c, respectively. If these values are NULL the old default
   values "Experimental" and "Control" are used.

Functions metabin, metacont, metagen:
 - arguments label.e and label.c added

Function metacr:
 - use arguments label.e and label.c in calls to functions
   metabin, metacont, metagen
