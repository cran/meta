Function summary.meta:
 - modified so that results for subgroups (if byvar != NULL)
   are calculated for both fixed effect and random effects model:
   * list 'within' no longer returned by function summary.meta
   * lists 'within.fixed' and 'within.random' returned by
     function summary.meta
 - modified so that variable name of subgroups is printed
   correctly
 - check whether input is an object of class summary.meta

Function print.summary.meta:
 - modified so that a warning is printed if both comb.fixed and
   comb.random are TRUE and results for subgroups are supposed to
   be printed

Help pages of functions print.summary.meta and forest updated:
 - detailed information on printing and plotting of subgroup
   results if both comb.fixed and comb.random are TRUE

Help page of function metagen updated:
 - new example with meta-analysis of survival data


2009-10-30, version 1.1-3

New functions trimfill, trimfill.default and trimfill.meta:
 - generic method for trim-and-fill method


2009-10-09, version 1.1-2

New functions labbe, labbe.default, labbe.metabin:
 - produce L'Abbe plots

New functions funnel, funnel.default and funnel.meta:
 - generic method for funnel plots

Functions funnel.default and funnel.meta:
 - modified so that contour-enhanced funnel plots can be produced
   (new arguments: contour.levels, col.contour, ref)
 - modified so that study labels can be printed on funnel plot
   (new arguments: studlab, cex.studlab)
 - modified so that line type, width and colour can be changed for
   fixed effect treatment effect
   (new arguments: lty.fixed, lwd.fixed, col.fixed)
 - modified so that random effects treatment effect can be plotted
   (new arguments: comb.random, lty.random, lwd.random, col.random)
 - new default values for arguments:
   * pch=21 (previously: pch=1)
   * comb.fixed=x$comb.fixed
 - modified so that background colour of points in funnel plot can
   be changed
   (new argument: bg)

Function forest:
 - new default values for arguments lab.e and lab.c: x$label.e and
   x$label.c, respectively. If these values are NULL the old default
   values "Experimental" and "Control" are used.

Functions metabin, metacont, metagen:
 - arguments label.e and label.c added

Function metacr:
 - use arguments label.e and label.c in calls to functions
   metabin, metacont, metagen
